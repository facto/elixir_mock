# ElixirMock (alpha)

Creates mock modules based on real elixir modules for testing. The mocks are inspectable and they don't replace
the original modules the are based on.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `elixir_mock` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:elixir_mock, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```
